# Palette

I made this project to explore paintings' main colors.

Sub project [palette-back](https://github.com/pielc/palette-back) gets paintings from [Art Institute of Chicago API](https://api.artic.edu/docs/#introduction) then analyse pixel colors with a kmeans algorythm to extract main colors.

This project get those results and show one painting per day.
